## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a Software Engineer at a defense contractor, where I contribute to mission-critical projects for the U.S Department of Defense (DOD). My efforts focus on backend development, DevOps, and web infrastructure â€” building scalable systems, automating deployments, and optimizing cloud environments to support secure and reliable operations.
